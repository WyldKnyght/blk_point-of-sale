Here's a brief explanation of each folder/file:

Summary
Project Root: Contains high-level files like requirements.txt and README.md.
src/: The source code folder, containing all the Python code.
    main.py: The entry point of the application, responsible for launching the GUI.
    models/: Data models and database-related code.
    views/: GUI-related code.
    controllers/: Business logic and controller code.
    utils/: Utility functions and helpers.
    configs/: Configuration files.
docs/: Documentation files.
admin/: Project admin files.
database/: Database files.

Guidelines and Best Practices:
These guidelines will keep the code organized and easy to maintain as the project grows.
    Start with small modules in single files.
    Once you have many related files or a large one, move it inside a folder and break it up into smaller files.
    Keep files under a certain number of lines of code (LoC) to maintain readability and maintainability.
    Use an entry point with __main__.py to define the application's entry point.
