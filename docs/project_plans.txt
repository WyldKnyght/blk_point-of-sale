Based on your requirements, I'll provide a simplified project plan to develop a POS system for local use, with the ability to add web-based functions at a later date.

**Project Title:** Local POS System for Home-Based Business

**Project Objective:** Develop a simple, user-friendly POS system for a home-based business, using Python and related packages.

**Project Scope:**

* Develop a local POS system for two owners (husband and wife) with a single login and password protection.
* Implement inventory management, order management, and customer management features.
* Design a user-friendly interface for employees, similar to a fancy Excel spreadsheet with a dashboard.

**Project Timeline:** 8 weeks

**Project Phases:**

**Phase 1: Setting up the Environment (Week 1)**

* Set up the development environment with Python, PyCharm, and necessary packages (e.g., Tkinter for GUI, SQLite for database).
* Install and configure the necessary dependencies.

**Phase 2: Building the GUI (Week 2)**

* Design and build the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
* Create a simple and intuitive interface with a dashboard, similar to a fancy Excel spreadsheet.

**Phase 3: Creating the Database (Week 3)**

* Design and create a database using SQLite to store inventory, orders, and customer information.
* Implement data models and schema for the database.

**Phase 4: Implementing Inventory Management (Week 4)**

* Implement inventory management features, including:
	+ Adding and editing products.
	+ Tracking stock levels and low stock alerts.
	+ Generating reports for inventory management.

**Phase 5: Implementing Order Management (Week 5)**

* Implement order management features, including:
	+ Creating and managing orders.
	+ Tracking order status and history.
	+ Generating reports for order management.

**Phase 6: Implementing Customer Management (Week 6)**

* Implement customer management features, including:
	+ Adding and editing customer information.
	+ Tracking customer orders and history.
	+ Generating reports for customer management.

**Phase 7: Implementing Billing System (Week 7)**

* Implement a simple billing system, including:
	+ Calculating total prices and taxes.
	+ Generating invoices and receipts.

**Phase 8: Testing and Deployment (Week 8)**

* Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
* Deploy the POS system to a local environment.
* Provide training and support to the business owners.

**Project Deliverables:**

* A functional and user-friendly POS system for local use.
* A simple and intuitive interface with a dashboard.
* A database with inventory, order, and customer management features.
* A billing system with calculation and invoicing capabilities.

**Project Budget:** $5,000 - $7,000

**Project Resources:**

* 1 full-time developer with Python experience.
* PyCharm IDE and necessary packages.
* SQLite database management system.

By following this project plan, you'll have a simple and functional POS system for your home-based business, with the ability to add web-based functions at a later date.

Based on the advice you found, it's recommended to start with both the database schema and the GUI simultaneously, and then work towards the point where they meet. This approach is often referred to as a "meet-in-the-middle" approach.

Here's a breakdown of why this approach makes sense:

**Database Schema:**

* Starting with the database schema helps you define the structure and organization of your data.
* It forces you to think about the relationships between different data entities and how they'll be stored.
* Having a solid database schema in place will make it easier to implement the GUI and business logic later on.

**GUI:**

* Starting with the GUI helps you define the user interface and user experience.
* It forces you to think about how the user will interact with the system and what features are required.
* Having a solid GUI design in place will make it easier to implement the business logic and database interactions later on.

**Meet-in-the-Middle:**

* By working on both the database schema and GUI simultaneously, you can ensure that they're aligned and compatible.
* As you work on each component, you'll naturally reach a point where they need to interact with each other.
* This is where the business logic comes in, and you can implement the necessary code to connect the GUI to the database schema.

By following this approach, you'll avoid the pitfalls of starting with either the database or GUI alone, which can lead to:

* A database schema that's not well-suited for the GUI's needs.
* A GUI that's not well-suited for the database schema's structure.

So, to answer your question, the best place to start is with both the database schema and GUI, and then work towards the point where they meet.
